# CSE 167 HW2

## Optimization I done:
1. bounding box for faster rendering
2. clipping as extra credit for 2_1 for allow even if one vertex is outside the screen is still render

## Normal Part
1. using the same way as write up instruct to run
2. pre-rendering image is in `output` folder
3. My own scene is in `output` folder named `hw_2_5.png`
4. Animation is in `output/animation` folder for cube and prism. The teapot do not have translation animation.


More usage of the function see comments

## Extra Credit
### Part Completed:
1. 2-1 clipping
2. TODO
3. 2-4 animation
